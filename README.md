Serve-JS was inspired By [@midnqp Frameworkless](https://github.com/midnqp/frameworkless)
* __Its easy to write__: Any who knows simple html and css is good to go, except for writing the server side logic if required means one should have knowledge of nodejs.
* __Node in HTML__: Allows you write nodejs code inside html
* __Routing__: It performs the routing for you. So no need to worry about url paths, except you need to customize the endpoints.

## Features
* __Resuable Components__: You could build encapsulated components that manage their own logic and state. This could be used to build even more complex UIs.
* __Routing__: Serve-JS does automatic routing for you even without you writing server code.
